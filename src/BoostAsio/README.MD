# Boost ASIO

## Introduction

This is a repository that shows basic use of Boost's ASIO functionality.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Boost 1.72.0 (x64) installed. The easiest way to do this is to install `vcpkg` and enable integrations into VS. When you have `vcpkg` installed, install boost with the following command `.\vcpkg install boost:64-windows`. Note that Boost doesn't compile properly if the C++ standard is set to "Latest C++ features".
